# SSW590-Project


## Calculator/Problem Solver Website:

### Nick Katzenberger, Brandon Penman, Carl Guillaume, Akram Amer

This project aims to create a simple Calculator website that is able to solve simple and complex math problems through user input. With this website, we want to document the performance of the program by using two different web hosting applications: AWS and Azure. We will also compare continuous integration pipelines using CircleCI and Github Actions when developing the project. This way we can have 4 different methods for accessing the project. We will upload the project code onto a Github repository and utilize different branches or folders for different hosting methods (Azure/AWS). 

This website will allow users free and easy access to a multi-function calculator that is able to solve for missing variables, perform trigonometric functions, store custom variables, and allow users to copy and paste equations into the calculator for fast and easy computation. In addition, the calculator will store the input history and answer history so users can easily re-enter equations from the past to calculate them with different numbers. 

Our report will focus on the development, build times, and analysis of the website running through different pipelines and hosting services. We will make regular updates on the progress of the different builds to ensure that our final report on the project is accurate with the history of its development. In summation, we want to ensure that we do not miss essential problems that impeded the building of the website through these different services. On the other hand, we also donâ€™t want to leave out reporting certain features that enhance development. By the end of the project, we want to have near-definitive answers on which CI/CD methods and hosting services worked the best for our website.
